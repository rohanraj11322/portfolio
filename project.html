                    <h1>Treatment of Phenylketonuria (PKU)</h1>
                    
                    <p>
                        Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder. we concluded in a direction towards a probability, that the utilization of genetically derived flavone biosynthetic pathway in human may regulate the phenylalanine equilibrium across the body and as a result, this utilization procedure can deduce the effects of hyperphenylalaninemia and with O-methylation property of BcOMT2 (a flavone biosynthetic pathway enzyme) a positive advantage may be introduced to the body of PKU affected patients that will help them to fight against other cellular and metabolic disorder such as cancer, varicose veins, cholesterol, etc.

                        In this android app users can see all Indiaâ€™s state wise list of Covid-19
                        cases including Active, Death and Cured cases. To show all the data I used Nested Recycler view. API is used to retrieve all data using Volley Library.
                        App also contains a simple pie chart as a main screen which shows the
                        percentage of active, cured and death cases.
